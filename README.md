Neigborhood map Project  
---------------------
-It's a map of my neighborhood. I add map markers to identify popular locations, search function to easily discover 
 these locations, listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 
-In this application I do researches and implement the Wikipedia third-party API that provide Wikipedia articles
 about each of my locations .

Prerequisites
-------------
-You should have a browser on your PC to show the application running , Google chrome is recommended.    

Guidelines
----------
-After making sure you are connected correctly to the internet you can open project.html file & explore it.
-The application by default display google map of Egypt country and markers on the popular locations in Egypt. 
-You will find a list of the same popular location on the left of the map and search box used to  filter
 the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input.
-When you click on any marker on the map or on any list item you will display Wikipedia article about this location,
 and bouncing its associated map marker.


Notes
-----
-I used Knockout documentation & stack overflow as a reference to me to apply some functions and I read
 a lot of articles in the udacity forums to understand people & forum mentor ideas (as the instructor recommend),
 then I applied everything by myself to maintain the honor of code.
